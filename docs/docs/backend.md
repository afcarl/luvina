# Luvina backends

Luvina does not handle low level functionalities by itself; instead, it relies on already optimized libraries:

Luvina currently supports functionalities from two backends:
 
- [spaCy](https://spacy.io/) is an Industrial-strength Natural Language Processing (NLP) with Python and Cython
- [gensim](https://radimrehurek.com/gensim/index.html) is a Python library for topic modelling, document indexing and similarity retrieval.
