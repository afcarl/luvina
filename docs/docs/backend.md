# Luvina backends

Luvina does not handle low level functionalities by itself; instead, it relies on already optimized libraries:

Luvina currently supports functionalities from two backends:
 
- [spaCy](https://spacy.io/) is an Industrial-strength Natural Language Processing (NLP) with Python and Cython
- [NLTK](http://www.nltk.org/) is a Python library with easy-to-use interfaces and suite of text-processing libraries.
